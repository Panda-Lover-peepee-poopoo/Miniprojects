Components Needed:

Arduino Uno or similar microcontroller board
Heart rate sensor (e.g., Pulse Sensor)
Temperature sensor (e.g., LM35)
Blood pressure sensor (e.g., sphygmomanometer with pressure sensor)
Wi-Fi module (e.g., ESP8266)
Breadboard and jumper wires
Optional: LCD display (e.g., 16x2 LCD) for displaying real-time data


Step 1: Set up the Hardware

Connect the heart rate sensor to the analog input pin A0 on the Arduino board.
Connect the temperature sensor to the analog input pin A1 on the Arduino board.
Connect the blood pressure sensor to the appropriate pins on the Arduino board as per the manufacturer's instructions.
Connect the Wi-Fi module to the appropriate pins on the Arduino board for communication with the internet.


Step 2: Set up the Software

Install the necessary libraries for the sensors and Wi-Fi module in the Arduino IDE.
Open the Arduino IDE and write the code for reading data from the sensors and sending it to the healthcare provider's dashboard using Wi-Fi. Here's an example code snippet to get you started:

            #include <WiFi.h>

            // Replace with your network credentials
            const char* ssid = "your_SSID";
            const char* password = "your_PASSWORD";

            // Replace with your healthcare provider's dashboard URL
            const char* serverUrl = "https://your_healthcare_provider_dashboard.com";

            void setup() {
            // Initialize serial communication
            Serial.begin(115200);

            // Connect to Wi-Fi
            WiFi.begin(ssid, password);
            while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
                delay(1000);
                Serial.println("Connecting to WiFi...");
            }
            Serial.println("Connected to WiFi");

            // Set up sensors and other hardware
            // ... (code for setting up heart rate, temperature, and blood pressure sensors)
            }

            void loop() {
            // Read data from sensors
            int heartRate = analogRead(A0);
            int temperature = analogRead(A1);
            // ... (code for reading blood pressure sensor data)

            // Send data to healthcare provider's dashboard
            // ... (code for sending data to the server using HTTP or other protocols)

            // Check for abnormal readings and send alerts if needed
            // ... (code for checking for abnormal readings and sending alerts)

            // Delay for a certain interval before taking readings again
            delay(5000); // Adjust delay time as needed
            }


Step 3: Assemble the Wearable Device

Connect the sensors and other components to the Arduino board as per the circuit diagram in Tinkercad or as per the manufacturer's instructions.
Upload the code to the Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.


Step 4: Test and Monitor

Power on the wearable device and wear it on the patient as instructed by the healthcare provider.
Verify that the sensor data is being sent to the healthcare provider's dashboard and displayed correctly.
Monitor the real-time data on the dashboard and check for any abnormal readings.
If abnormal readings are detected, the healthcare provider can intervene timely by sending alerts or taking appropriate actions.

Note: This is a basic example of an IoT-based health monitoring wearable device, and there may be additional steps or customization required based on your specific requirements and healthcare provider's dashboard setup. Always follow best practices for privacy, security, and data handling in healthcare applications, and ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
